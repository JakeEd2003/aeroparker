Hello,
This task was fun and a relitively new experience for me. I have experience in java but i have never worked with Spring Boot before so this was a fun thing to research. i enjoyed the getting over the hurdles of learning this task and reserching the in's and out's of Spring Boot basics.
Hope you enjoy!
